# OctaPi: Public Key Cryptography

In this resource you will learn about the ideas behind public key cryptography (PKC), including the concepts of a __public key__ and a __private key__. With this background on PKC, you will test your understanding by answering questions and completing a Python programming challenge. You will then use the OctaPi to find prime factors with a brute-force method.
